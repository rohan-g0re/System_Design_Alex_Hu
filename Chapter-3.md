## 4 Main Steps that were given:

1. We do not need to get directly into designing but understand the problem and establish design scope. In this process, we need to ask lots and lots of questions about the requirements of the system that we want to build.

2. Propose a high-level design and get a buy-in. We come with the initial blueprints and ask for feedback and keep on iterating until the interviewer accepts the basic architecture that we have built.

3. Designing in deep dive. This can possibly have two subsections:
- You have to dive deep in designing one of the components.
- You have to dive deep in designing the system for one of the use cases.

4. Wrap up. In wrap up, we always need to have something in a pocket to give at the end to the interviewer
    - Identify the system bottlenecks and discuss potential improvements.
    - Never say your design is perfect and nothing can be improved. There is always something to improve upon.
    - Give the interviewer a recap of your design.
    - Interesting things to talk about: 
        - Tell about the Error cases (server failure, network loss, etc.) are interesting to talk about.
        - Operation issues are worth mentioning. How do you monitor metrics and error logs? OR How to roll out the system?
        - How to handle the next scale curve is also an interesting topic. For example, if your current design supports 1 million users, what changes do you need to make to support 10 million users?


## Time management
